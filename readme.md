# Learning GO

"The main aim of this repo is to learn the language GO and create short notes / demo files."

For this purpose, I'm following the video series by Hitesh Choudhary on Youtube.

`Go is a very unique language. So one should not bring the baggage from other languages and try to get the essence of Go `

This is because language influences thought, and Go wants the user to think about problems in a certain way.

Each folder in the repo tries to explain a certain aspect or feature of the language. (The folders are in the same order as in the series)

Within each folder, there are Go files.
Each file starts with a short summary / note and then the demo code with comments.

While creating a new folder, it is good practice to initialise a go mod file. This can be done by `go mod init <module_name>`.
The same has been followed for all the folders here.
