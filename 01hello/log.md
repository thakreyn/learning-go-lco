# Folder 1: 01Hello

* 3rd September 2021
    
    1. Installed Golang and Set up all the Go tools available in the VScod extensions.
    2. Created a new Go file.
    3. Ran `go mod init hello`. The purpose of this command is still unknown. It creates a module of some sort.
    4. Go uses `fmt` for input and output.
    5. Libraries are imported automatically.
    6. Function decleration

        ```go
        func <name>()
        {
            . . . 
        }
        ```
    7. `go run <filename>` runs the file, but does not build the executables.
